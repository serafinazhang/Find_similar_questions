# Finding Similar Questions for Stack Overflow

Junqian Zhang

**Abstract:**

This project aims to use Locality Sensitive Hashing to provide an efficient solution for finding similar question on Stack Overflow. It carries out experiments with traditional exhaustive search and Locality Sensitive Hashing by PySpark respectively, over a series of dataset with different size. Finally it compares the computation time and similar pairs detected on both methods. Through these experiments LSH proves its advantage in finding similar items in large-scale dataset.
